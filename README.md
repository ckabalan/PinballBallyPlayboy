2020-07-10 - Both flippers rebuilt. Flipper rebuild kit had incorrect nylon flipper bushing and coil sleeves. Used flipper bushing and coil sleeves from very old unused parts. Left flipper sticks out of coil 1/16" more than the right coil. I can't see how this is possible with all new parts except for if the flipper shaft hole in the flipper plate is slightly off.
